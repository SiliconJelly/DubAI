## Requirements Fulfilled

This implementation satisfies all requirements from Task 12:

### ✅ Requirement 3.6: Real-time Updates
- Real-time download progress tracking
- Live status updates during file operations

### ✅ Requirement 4.6: User Experience  
- Intuitive file management interface
- Comprehensive download and sharing options
- Quality feedback collection

### ✅ Requirement 6.3: File Storage Management

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { FileDownloadManager } from './components/dashboard/FileDownloadManager';

function Dashboard() {
  const [jobs, setJobs] = useState<DubbingJob[]>([]);
  const [selectedJob, setSelectedJob] = useState<DubbingJob>();

  return (
    <FileDownloadManager 
      jobs={jobs}
      selectedJob={selectedJob}
      onJobSelect={setSelectedJob}
    />
  );
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Batch Operations**: Multi-file download and organization
2. **Advanced Search**: Full-text search across file contents
3. **File Versioning**: Track file versions and changes
4. **Export Options**: Bulk export to cloud storage services
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Detailed usage and performance analytics
6. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced mobile file management experience

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Components load data on-demand
- **Pagination**: Large file lists are paginated
- **Caching**: Download URLs and metadata are cached
- **Debounced Search**: Search operations are debounced for performance
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Large lists use virtual scrolling (ready for implementation)
