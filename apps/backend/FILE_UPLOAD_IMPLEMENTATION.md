# File Upload and Storage System Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete implementation of the file upload and storage system for the DubAI backend, fulfilling task 5 from the implementation plan.

## âœ… Implemented Components

### 1. File Storage Service (`FileStorageService.ts`)

**Core Features:**
- âœ… Multipart file upload handling
- âœ… Supabase Storage integration for secure file management
- âœ… File validation and processing pipeline
- âœ… Organized folder structure for user files
- âœ… File metadata tracking and database storage

**Key Methods:**
- `validateFile()` - Validates file size, type, and content
- `uploadFile()` - Uploads files to Supabase Storage with metadata
- `getFileMetadata()` - Retrieves file information with fresh signed URLs
- `listUserFiles()` - Lists user files with filtering and pagination
- `deleteFile()` - Removes files from both storage and database
- `cleanupExpiredFiles()` - Manages temporary file cleanup
- `getUserStorageStats()` - Provides storage usage statistics

**Validation Features:**
- File size limits (500MB max)
- MIME type validation for video, audio, and SRT files
- SRT content format validation
- Organized storage path generation
- Temporary file management with expiration

### 2. File Processing Pipeline (`FileProcessingPipeline.ts`)

**Core Features:**
- âœ… Video file analysis and metadata extraction
- âœ… SRT file parsing and validation
- âœ… Audio extraction from video files
- âœ… File compatibility validation for dubbing workflow
- âœ… Organized job workspace creation

**Key Methods:**
- `analyzeVideoFile()` - Extracts video metadata (duration, resolution, etc.)
- `analyzeSRTFile()` - Parses SRT content and validates format
- `extractAudioFromVideo()` - Extracts audio tracks for processing
- `validateFilesForDubbing()` - Cross-validates video and subtitle compatibility
- `createJobWorkspace()` - Creates organized folder structure for processing jobs

### 3. Service Factory (`serviceFactory.ts`)

**Core Features:**
- âœ… Centralized service initialization
- âœ… Dependency injection for all file-related services
- âœ… Configuration management integration

**Initialized Services:**
- FileStorageService
- FileProcessingPipeline
- FileManager
- ConfigurationManager

### 4. API Routes (`fileRoutes.ts`)

**Implemented Endpoints:**
- âœ… `POST /files/upload` - Multi-file upload with validation
- âœ… `GET /files/:id` - Get file metadata
- âœ… `GET /files/:id/download` - Generate download URLs
- âœ… `GET /files/` - List user files with filtering
- âœ… `DELETE /files/:id` - Delete files

**Features:**
- Multer integration for multipart uploads
- Rate limiting for upload endpoints
- Authentication middleware integration
- Comprehensive error handling
- File validation middleware

### 5. Database Schema

**Tables:**
- âœ… `storage_files` - File metadata and references
- âœ… `user_profiles` - User information and usage tracking
- âœ… `dubbing_jobs` - Job tracking with file references

**Key Fields:**
- File metadata (size, type, MIME type)
- Storage paths and signed URLs
- Temporary file management
- User ownership and access control
