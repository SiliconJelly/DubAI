# Frontend Development Standards

## UI/UX Design Principles
- Create futuristic, responsive web interface using Tailwind CSS
- Implement smooth animations and transitions using Framer Motion
- Follow mobile-first responsive design approach
- Use consistent color scheme and typography throughout the application
- Implement intuitive navigation with clear visual hierarchy
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA standards)

## Component Architecture
- Use Next.js 14 with TypeScript for type safety and performance
- Create reusable components with proper prop typing
- Implement component composition patterns for flexibility
- Use React hooks for state management and side effects
- Follow atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- Implement proper component testing with React Testing Library

## State Management
- Use Zustand for lightweight, efficient state management
- Implement proper state normalization for complex data structures
- Use React Query for server state management and caching
- Implement optimistic updates for better user experience
- Handle loading and error states consistently across components

## Real-time Features
- Implement WebSocket connections for live processing updates
- Use Socket.io for reliable real-time communication
- Handle connection failures and reconnection gracefully
- Implement real-time progress indicators for long-running processes
- Update UI reactively based on real-time data changes

## File Upload & Processing
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality for SRT and video files
- Add file validation (format, size, content) before upload
- Show upload progress with visual indicators
- Handle large file uploads with chunking and resume capability
- Provide clear feedback for upload success/failure states

## Video Integration
- Embed Dailymotion videos seamlessly within the platform
- Implement video player controls and quality selection
- Handle video loading states and error conditions
- Synchronize dubbed audio with video playback
- Implement language switching without interrupting playback

## Performance Optimization
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading for better performance
- Use Next.js Image component for optimized image loading
- Implement proper caching strategies for static assets
- Minimize bundle size through tree shaking and dead code elimination
- Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive computations

## User Experience
- Implement intuitive onboarding flow for new users
- Provide clear visual feedback for all user actions
- Handle error states gracefully with helpful error messages
- Implement keyboard navigation and shortcuts
- Add loading skeletons for better perceived performance
- Ensure consistent interaction patterns across the application

## Security & Data Handling
- Validate all user inputs on the client side
- Implement proper authentication state management
- Handle sensitive data securely (no logging of credentials)
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement proper CORS handling
- Sanitize user-generated content before display

## Testing & Quality
- Write unit tests for all utility functions and hooks
- Implement integration tests for critical user flows
- Use visual regression testing for UI components
- Test responsive design across different screen sizes
- Implement accessibility testing with automated tools
- Test real-time features with mock WebSocket connections
