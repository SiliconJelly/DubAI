# DubAI Full-Stack MVP Integration Requirements

## Introduction

DubAI is a revolutionary cross-platform movie dubbing SaaS that transforms English video content into high-quality Bangla dubbed videos. This specification focuses on creating a complete full-stack MVP by integrating the existing Node.js/TypeScript backend (with Whisper, Google TTS, and Coqui TTS) with the Kombai-generated React frontend, and deploying it as a fully functional application on Supabase. The MVP will provide a seamless user experience from movie upload to final dubbed output, with real-time processing updates and professional-grade results.
