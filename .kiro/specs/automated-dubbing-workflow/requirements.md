# DubAI Requirements Document

## Introduction

DubAI is a revolutionary AI-powered movie localization platform that transforms video content into high-quality dubbed versions using advanced AI agents. The system operates as an intelligent pipeline where users upload video files, and the platform automatically finds matching subtitles from OpenSubtitles.org, translates them using Whisper models, and generates human-like voiceovers using trained AI voice agents. The Q1 MVP focuses on two core co-dependent functions: (1) Whisper-powered translation from English to target language with subtitle matching, and (2) AI voice agent system that creates contextual, human-like voiceovers with perfect audio synchronization. The platform leverages Kiro's agent steering, hooks, and MCP servers for automated development and deployment workflows.

## Q1 MVP Requirements (Two-Function Core)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dailymotion Video Integration & Automated Subtitle Matching System
