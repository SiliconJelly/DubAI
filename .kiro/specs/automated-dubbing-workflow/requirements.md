# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Automated Dubbing Workflow is a cost-effective micro SaaS solution that transforms English video content into high-quality Bangla dubbed videos. The system combines open-source tools (FFmpeg, Whisper) with affordable cloud TTS services (Google Cloud TTS) and local alternatives (Coqui TTS) to create a scalable dubbing pipeline. The solution minimizes reliance on expensive proprietary services while maintaining professional quality output with perfect synchronization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Audio Extraction

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to extract audio from my English video files, so that I can process the audio separately for dubbing workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a video file THEN the system SHALL extract the audio track using FFmpeg
2. WHEN the audio extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL save the audio file in a supported format (WAV/MP3)
3. IF the video file is corrupted or unsupported THEN the system SHALL return an error message with supported formats
4. WHEN extracting audio THEN the system SHALL preserve the original audio quality and timestamps

### Requirement 2: Transcription and Translation

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to transcribe English audio and translate it to Bangla with precise timestamps, so that I can maintain perfect synchronization in the final dubbed video.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio is extracted THEN the system SHALL use Whisper large-v3 model to transcribe English audio locally
2. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL translate the English text to Bangla using Whisper's translation feature
3. WHEN translation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate an SRT file with precise timestamps
4. IF transcription fails THEN the system SHALL retry with different Whisper model parameters
5. WHEN generating SRT THEN the system SHALL preserve original timing intervals for perfect lip-sync

### Requirement 3: TTS Service Management with A/B Testing

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to test different TTS services (Google Cloud TTS vs Coqui TTS), so that I can optimize for cost and quality based on performance metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a dubbing request THEN the system SHALL support both Google Cloud TTS and Coqui TTS options
2. WHEN using Google Cloud TTS THEN the system SHALL track API usage against the 4 million character free tier
3. WHEN using Coqui TTS THEN the system SHALL process audio generation locally with zero API costs
4. WHEN A/B testing is enabled THEN the system SHALL randomly assign requests to different TTS services
5. WHEN generating audio THEN the system SHALL collect quality metrics (processing time, file size, user satisfaction)
6. IF Google Cloud TTS quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to Coqui TTS

### Requirement 4: Bangla Voice Generation

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to generate high-quality Bangla voiceover from translated text, so that my dubbed content sounds natural and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SRT file is ready THEN the system SHALL iterate through each dialogue line with timestamps
2. WHEN using Google Cloud TTS THEN the system SHALL use WaveNet voices for high-fidelity output
3. WHEN using Coqui TTS THEN the system SHALL generate natural-sounding Bangla speech locally
4. WHEN generating voice segments THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent voice characteristics across all segments
5. IF voice generation fails for any segment THEN the system SHALL retry with alternative voice settings
6. WHEN voice generation is complete THEN the system SHALL save individual audio segments with timestamp metadata

### Requirement 5: Video Assembly and Synchronization

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to combine the original video with the new Bangla audio track, so that I get a perfectly synchronized dubbed video.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all voice segments are generated THEN the system SHALL use FFmpeg to combine original video with Bangla audio
2. WHEN combining tracks THEN the system SHALL preserve original video quality and resolution
3. WHEN synchronizing audio THEN the system SHALL use precise timestamps to ensure perfect lip-sync
4. WHEN assembly is complete THEN the system SHALL generate the final dubbed video file
5. IF synchronization issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logs with timestamp mismatches

### Requirement 6: Cost Tracking and Optimization

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to track processing costs and optimize resource usage, so that I can maintain profitability while scaling the service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL track Google Cloud TTS API usage and costs
2. WHEN using local processing THEN the system SHALL monitor computational resource usage
3. WHEN monthly usage approaches limits THEN the system SHALL send alerts to administrators
4. WHEN cost thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to more cost-effective options
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide detailed cost breakdowns per video processed

### Requirement 7: Quality Assurance and Validation

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to validate the quality of dubbed content before final delivery, so that I can ensure professional standards are met.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dubbing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide audio quality metrics (clarity, volume consistency)
2. WHEN synchronization is complete THEN the system SHALL validate timestamp accuracy within acceptable thresholds
3. WHEN quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL flag content for manual review
4. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL mark the dubbed video as ready for delivery
5. IF quality standards are not met THEN the system SHALL provide specific improvement recommendations

### Requirement 8: Scalability and Future Migration Planning

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to plan for scaling from local processing to cloud infrastructure, so that I can handle increased demand while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN local processing reaches capacity limits THEN the system SHALL provide migration recommendations
2. WHEN planning cloud migration THEN the system SHALL estimate costs for different cloud providers
3. WHEN scaling up THEN the system SHALL support distributed processing across multiple instances
4. WHEN migrating to cloud THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing workflow configurations
5. IF migration is needed THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step migration guides with cost projections
