# DubAI Requirements Document

## Introduction

DubAI is a revolutionary cross-platform micro-SaaS that serves as a comprehensive movie ecosystem, combining intelligent movie cataloging, subtitle management, and high-quality dubbing services. The Q1 MVP focuses on two core functions: (1) English SRT → Bangla SRT translation with movie analysis, and (2) Bangla SRT → High-quality dub audio generation. The platform operates locally for cost-effectiveness while providing a foundation for Q2's full movie ecosystem platform.
